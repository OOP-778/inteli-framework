  # How resetting works?
  resetting:

    # There's two modes PERCENTAGE and TIMED
    # Percentage will run when x rate of blocks are left
    # Timed will happen on mine load and when x time is passed after load
    mode: PERCENTAGE

    # If percentage the value should be a number between 0 and 100% of blocks left
    # If timed the value should be xDxHxMxS where D stands for days, H stands for hours, M for minutes and S for seconds
    value: 60%

  # Materials used to generate mine
  # The rate cannot exceed or be lower than 100!
